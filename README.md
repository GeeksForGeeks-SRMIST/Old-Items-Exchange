#👨‍🎓MENTORS
- This project was a part of GFG-SRM chapter , which was mentored by DEV ARYAN SRIVASTAVA,DHARINI GROVER,RISHABH ABHANI 

## 💥 Inspiration
> We have got the inspiration to make this project from the fact that when our seniors vacate their flat or PG rooms, they sell all their stuff to the local shop keepers, who in turn sell these stuff to the other students at a higher price, so our project aims to eliminate these middle men and so that students can get stuff at a fair price .
